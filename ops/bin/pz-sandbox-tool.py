"""Sandbox options: the world's rules, in `<server>_SandboxVars.lua`.

This is a different file, with different semantics, from the `.ini` that `/pz config`
edits, and conflating the two is the easiest mistake to make here:

|  | `<server>.ini` | `<server>_SandboxVars.lua` |
|---|---|---|
| Holds | how the *server* runs -- slots, PVP, chat | how the *world* works -- time, zombies |
| Applied by | RCON `reloadoptions`, live | reading the file at startup |
| Changing it means | nothing, it is instant | **a restart** |

Invoked by the `pz-prod-sandbox` SSM document with a fixed command line and
pattern-constrained parameters, so `path`/`key`/`value` arrive as plain argv rather than
text interpolated into a shell string (issue #29). This file's canonical copy is
`pzbot/src/pzbot/sandbox.py` -- the bot imports it there for the settings table and
`/pz sandbox` validation, and it is unit-tested there. The two must be kept in sync by
hand until pzbot's companion issue resolves the duplication (importing nothing outside
the standard library is what makes copying it here safe in the meantime).
